TINT Is Not Tetris(tm) ...at least the name isn't
=================================================

---

As the title suggests, this is a clone of the original tetris game
written by Alexey Pajitnov, Dmitry Pavlovsky, and Vadim Gerasimov.

The game is as close to the original as possible, but there are a few
differences. Nevertheless, it's probably the closest to the original
that you'll ever find in the UNIX world...
