Many thanks to the authors of the original tetris(tm) on which this
game is based:

  Alexey Pajitnov
  Dmitry Pavlovsky
  Vadim Gerasimov

Here is some links to pay tribute to their efforts:

  http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2430/tetris.html
  http://atarihq.com/tsr/special/tetrishist.html

As you'll see from those pages, there is a certain evil company prohibiting
software such as this. This is unfortunate and is also the reason why you
have to type tint each time you want to play the game instead
you-know-what :P

Here is a list of people who have written code for tint:

  Robert Lemmen
  Marcello Mamino

Thanks for your contributions.
